# 🏫 Student Practice Task: School Exam Score Report System (2D Arrays in Java)

## 📘 Overview

In this task, you will build a simple Java program that helps a school principal keep track of student performance across multiple terms. You’ll use **two-dimensional arrays** to store and report student exam marks.

This task is designed to help you:

✅ Declare and populate a 2D array  
✅ Print rows and columns  
✅ Accumulate totals using a 2D array  
✅ Calculate averages  
✅ Produce a clear report for each student

## 🎯 Scenario

You are helping a **school principal** to create a Java application that stores and reports exam marks for **3 students** across **4 terms**. Each row in the 2D array represents a student, and each column represents a term.

Your program will:

- Store marks in a 2D array  
- Print all marks in tabular form  
- Calculate **total marks per student**  
- Calculate **average marks per term**  
- Display a **final summary report**

## 🧪 Task Requirements

1. Declare a 2D array of marks similar to this:

```java
int[][] marks = {
    {75, 82, 91, 78}, // Amina
    {64, 70, 72, 68}, // Ben
    {88, 90, 85, 92}  // Chloe
};

```

Sample of Report:
```java

## Final Report:
Student    T1   T2   T3   T4   Total
Amina      75   82   91   78   326
Ben        64   70   72   68   274
Chloe      88   90   85   92   355

```
